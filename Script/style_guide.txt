JupiterJaeden's kOS Style Guide

Naming Case Conventions:
- All local & global variables should be named with lowercase_snake_case.
- Filenames should also use lowercase_snake_case.
- All functions should be named usingPascalCase.
- Names should favor being more descriptive over being shorter.
- Any script declaring global functions should be considered a library and the filename should be prefixed with "lib".
- All keywords should be lowercase. Exceptions are SAS and RCS keywords.

Keyword Conventions:
- All local variables should use "declare local [name] to [value]"
- Similarly, global variables should use "declare global [name] to [value]"
- All parameter declarations should use "declare parameter"
- All functions should use "local function" or "global function", don't use "declare"
- runpath() should always be preferred over run.

Other Conventions/General Principles:
- All scripts should be well-commented, and each script and function should have an explanation of what it does.
- All parameters should be declared at the start of the function. All script-level variables should be declared at the top of the script (using local keyword). No global or script-level variable should be declared within a function.
- Global variables should be avoided if at all possible. All functions should be local to the script unless they are meant to be exported as part of a library.
- All code other than global or script-level variable declarations should be contained in functions. This allows usage of the return keyword and is generally cleaner.
- Each script and function should be as self-contained and modular as possible. Global variables should generally be avoided.
